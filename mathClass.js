// in thjs chapter we will know about math classes
// so basically Math is a global class having different functions that make our life easy in daily 
// life programming
const num = 29.2342323;
console.log(Math.ceil(num));


// so there are various methods that can be used to calculate differnt mathematic operations
//      function   =>       work
//      round               to round up the value upto nearest number
//      floor               convert the float value into integer type
//      toFixed             change the large decimal value upto desired decimal places
//      ceil                used to round the next value
//      abs                 converts the negative number to a positive only
//      sqrt                funtions is used to calculate the square root of the number
//      pow                 functions is used to calculate the power of the number 
//      min                 to find the min of the number
//      max                 to find the max of the number
