// today we will learn about data types of javascript
//there are many types of data types
let age=10 // its a number type of data type
let myname="Sowmya" // its a string tyoe of data type
let goal; //its an undefined data type 
let bool=true // its an boolean type of data type

let tommorrow=null // actually its type is defined as null its an standalone datatype.
                    // if haven't assigned anything to a variable and we want to occupy its sapce we can use null
// symbol is an unique data type
//suppose we want to use integer but that is greater than the range of normal integer then we use big Integer


//lets see the output of all these variables what types pf datatypes are they

console.table(["age is " +typeof(age),"name is "+ typeof(myname),"goal is "+typeof(goal)+" and bool is "+typeof(bool)])


//another datatypes are obejcts
