// so like every other language javascript also have same operation and operators
// you can add multiply subtract divide and find the modulo
// how ever using same data type there wont be any problem but using diffrent data type lets see

// console.log("2"+1);// it will be "21 " because after string it treats all the numbers as string in addition
//console.log("21"*2);// but all other operators will just perform the mathematical operations
//console.log(true+1);// true will be converted to 1 samewise false will be converted to 0
//console.log(true+"");// this will be converted to string

//*************************************comparision operator*********************** */

//for same datatype its easy to compare but for diffrent datatype it will less complicated

//console.log("21">43);// string will be treated as number
//console.log("a" < 21); // this line will return false
//console.log("s">"ta"); // ascii code is checked in here
//console.log(undefined>=1);// cant be evaluated
//by the way writing code like this will only make you have bad impression
